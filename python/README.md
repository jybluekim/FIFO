# FIFO
Circular FIFO implementation in Python  

How to run

> python FIFO.py

If you want to change the depth of FIFO, please change the number given to the instantiation. 

Currently the maximum # of items in the queue is queue size minus one. If we want to be aggressive we could put one more in but I will leave it this way for now.
